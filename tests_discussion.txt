Discussion of Test Results

I picked as many 7-letter wors that I thought were
appropriate. There are 6 test words with their
expected outputs. The expected outputs were 
generated using an online tool and we will assume
that it functions correctly.

I ran the tests several times and they are all 
running successfully. If they failed, the assert()
macro would abort the program.
